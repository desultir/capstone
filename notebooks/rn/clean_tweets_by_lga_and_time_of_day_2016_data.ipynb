forgive but never take back like judas saw some weeks ago that these alleged tweets were all disgraceful fabrication created by leftwing antagonisers shame there were similar twitter messages post over two weeks ago it appears that the fabrication is continuing because reliable intel sources have established clearly that the posts submitted previously were complete fabrications i'm far from being convinced about the legitimacy of these tweets as are many others time will of course reveal the truth interesting will watch these events with closer attention it would be travesty if these tweets are indeed fake yep have been watching imagine not what cannot verify if they are or are not i'm simply stating that the previous tweets were proven to be fabrications sad it appears that the world has sat on its ambivalent backside allowed slaughter to occur to what end some may ask it's bitter world sadly am not permitted to articulate my personal opinion here suffice to say the winter is coming trump targets cost blow outs on the 35 program not the aircraft itself he quite rightly questions bureaucratic bungles if was to have bitch to despite our fights it wouldn't surprise me if the table in my head turns seth horse ass assis was the dick in our relationship because remwbee plenty of fish said need talk assistant to say ritchie where the ultimate best friend of everything in

they have made mark in evil but not evil way #icons but to me to they might be icons in wax museum but they are not legends with history like if you think about it every music story they do shows all
