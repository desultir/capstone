0.5 excluding 9/11 your point don't think you're quite grasping the concept here.facts presented followed by writer's opinion tangential.the article quoted fact then commented upon by the the denial totally love the selfie-stick your using still waiting for you to show evidence of denial that 9/11 was an act of islamic terrorism think that concept has broad support.argument has always been the method hardly denial of its provenance ok its just quickly people forget history btw dont agree with excluding 9/11 dths.even when you include them the proposition hardly differs do you want to say

some one that did that to your son in your house it's like religion you forgive but never take back like judas saw some weeks ago that these alleged tweets were all disgraceful fabrication created by leftwing antagonisers shame there were similar twitter messages post over two weeks ago it appears that the fabrication is continuing because reliable intel sources have established clearly that the posts submitted previously were complete fabrications i'm far from being convinced about the legitimacy of these tweets as are many others time will of course reveal the truth interesting will watch these events with closer attention it would be travesty if these tweets are indeed fake yep have been watching imagine not what cannot verify if they are or are not i'm simply stating that the previous tweets were proven to be fabrications sad it appears that the world has sat on its ambivalent backside allowed slaughter to occur to what end some may ask it's bitter world sadly am not permitted to articulate my personal opinion here suffice to say the winter is coming trump targets cost blow outs on the 35 program not the aircraft itself he quite rightly questions bureaucratic
